## Hello! I'm Jocelyn.

I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of Chicago studying Computer Science (spec. HCI) and Media Arts and Design. I've done a variety of work across UI/UX and visual arts, but my primary interests lay within the interactions between people and their devices, focusing on product design.
